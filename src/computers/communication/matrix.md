# Matrix

[Matrix](matrix.org) is an open network for secure, decentralized communication.

## Clients

[Riot](https://about.riot.im/) is a client for the Matrix protocol. It has a web client as well as desktop and mobile clients.

## IRC Bridge

You can use Matrix to bridge to IRC channels. This allows you to use Matrix in place of an IRC bouncer, which means you can stay connected to IRC even if you close your Matrix client.
